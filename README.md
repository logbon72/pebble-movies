# Movie Times (formerly Pebble Movies)

**The highest rated movie show times application on Pebble  App Store**


This repository contains source code for Movie Times (formerly Pebble Movies).

As at the time of writing this document, I am not actively working on this project, for several personal reasons, however, I have been getting a lot of requests lately on bugs and crashes, hence this release.

Feel free to submit PR for this repository, I'll merge and publish when I can.

You can also submit issues here.

Thanks

PS: The server code is available at https://github.com/logbon72/pebble-movies-server, it is written in PHP and based on a framework I wrote called iDEO
