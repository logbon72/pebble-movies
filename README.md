# Pebble Movies

**The highest rated movie showtime application on Pebble  App Store**

This repositiry is contains source code for Pebble Movies. This source code was last tested against Pebble Watch OS 2.8, os there are no guarantees on whether it works for newer versions of the Pebble OS.

As at the time of writing this document, I am not actively working on this project, for several personal reasons, however, I have been getting a lot of requests lately on bugs and crashes, hence this release.

Feel free to submit PR for this repository, I'll merge and publish when I can.

Thanks

PS: The server code is available at https://github.com/logbon72/pebble-movies-server, it is written in PHP and based on a framework I wrote called iDEO
